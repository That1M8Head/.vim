# Arsalan Kazmi's Vim config

This is a hand-crafted config for Vim, inspired by SpaceVim and DOOM Emacs.

Leader key bindings take after DOOM Emacs, using mnemonics, and Emacs editing commands have been implemented.

## Installing

### Not Windows
```sh
git clone git@github.com:That1M8Head/.vim.git ~/vimfiles
```
### Windows
```sh
git clone git@github.com:That1M8Head/.vim.git ~/.vim
```

You should run `:PlugInstall` or `<SPC>rc` inside Vim after cloning the repo.
