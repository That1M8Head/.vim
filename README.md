# Arsalan Kazmi's Vim config

This is a from-scratch Vim config.

## Installing
```sh
git clone git@github.com:That1M8Head/.vim.git
```
You should run `:PlugInstall` inside Vim after cloning the repo.

If you're on Windows, make sure the repo is cloned to `vimfiles` instead of `.vim`.

## FAQ (only one of them)
### Why make your own config over something like SpaceVim?
Unlike Emacs, Vim actually has pretty good defaults. Configuring Vim from scratch is a *lot* easier than Emacs.
